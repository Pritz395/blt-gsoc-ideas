# Idea E-S — PR Risk Intelligence & Readiness Dashboard (350h)

## Overview
A 350-hour development effort focused on providing maintainers with decision-level intelligence for pull requests by combining readiness status, contextual risk scoring, and review signals.

Instead of acting as a vulnerability detection system, this project focuses on answering:
- Is this PR ready to merge?
- How risky is this change?
- Which PRs need immediate maintainer attention?

The system aggregates CI/CD status, review activity, repository context, and existing security signals to generate a PR Risk Score and actionable readiness insights. The goal is to reduce review fatigue, prioritize high-impact changes, and improve security awareness without blocking development.

## Key Differentiation
This project does not perform vulnerability scanning or create new security findings. Instead, it:
- Consumes existing signals (CI, security tools, repository context)
- Produces risk prioritization and decision intelligence
- Helps maintainers decide where to focus review effort

This makes it complementary to existing or communal security tooling.

## Goals

### PR Readiness Intelligence
- Aggregate CI/CD results from GitHub Actions and check-runs
- Detect readiness states:
  - READY
  - ACTION_REQUIRED
  - BLOCKED (CI or review)
  - HIGH_RISK_REVIEW_REQUIRED

### PR Risk Scoring Engine
Generate a contextual Risk Score (0–100) based on:

- Change Characteristics
  - Size of diff
  - Critical file modifications (auth, config, workflows)
  - Dependency updates
  - Infrastructure or CI changes

- Repository Sensitivity
  - Security-critical directories
  - Secrets/config locations
  - Workflow and deployment files

- Contributor Context
  - First-time contributor
  - Untrusted fork
  - Large or unusual change patterns

- Security Context (Signal Consumption Only)
  - Presence of SAST alerts
  - Secret scanning flags
  - Dependency vulnerabilities
  - (No new scanning performed)

### Review & Discussion Intelligence
- PR comment ingestion and threading
- Actionable vs non-actionable comment classification
- Reviewer intent detection:
  - Blocking
  - Needs changes
  - Suggestion
  - Nitpick
- Resolved vs unresolved discussion tracking

## Dashboard Capabilities

### Maintainer View
- PR Risk Score and category:
  - Low
  - Medium
  - High
  - Critical
- Queues:
  - High-risk PRs
  - Ready to merge
  - Blocked PRs
  - Waiting on contributor

### PR Detail View
- Risk factors explanation:
  - “Modifies authentication logic”
  - “Updates CI workflow permissions”
  - “Includes dependency upgrade with known vulnerabilities”
- CI/CD status summary
- Security signal summary (ingested, not generated)
- Review discussion status

## Security Focus (OWASP Alignment)
This project supports secure development by:
- Prioritizing changes that impact security-sensitive areas
- Highlighting risky workflow or configuration modifications
- Reducing the chance of high-risk changes being overlooked
- Encouraging human-in-the-loop security review

Important:
- No automated enforcement
- No CVE creation
- No exploit generation
- Advisory and prioritization only
