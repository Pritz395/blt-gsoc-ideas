# Project Ideas — Brief Overview

A short reference of BLT GSoC project options.

---

## Purpose

Synthesizes community direction (Discussion #5495). Each standalone project fits one 350-hour slot.

---

### Project A — CVE Detection & Validation Pipeline

[View full details →](Project-A.md)

**One line:** Opt-in pipeline from scanner/GitHub → NVD validation → GHSC model and verification UI/API.

---

### Project B — Security Contribution Gamification & Recognition

[View full details →](Project-B.md)

**Description:** Listens for verified GHSC (or equivalent) events and awards rewards idempotently: BACON, badges, reputation tiers (Beginner → Trusted), severity-weighted leaderboards, and security challenges. Includes admin audit and basic fraud controls. Does not do detection or NVD; assumes a feed of verified contributions (real or mocked).

**Add-on (optional): light C (education bridge)**  
Project B can be extended with a **light C** add-on in the same 350-hour slot. Light C is *not* a separate project: it adds read-only APIs and an optional webhook that expose badge/reputation and leaderboard data (no raw CVE or vulnerability details). Future education platforms can use these to unlock courses or show contributor standing. No labs, no curriculum — just the APIs so B's outputs can drive education tooling. The **recommended** proposal is **B + light C** as one project.
**One line:** Consume verified security contributions to award BACON/badges, reputation tiers, leaderboards, and challenges.

---

### Project C — blt-education Platform (standalone)

**One line:** Tiered learning tracks, hands-on labs, auto-quizzes, and instructor review workflows.

---

### Project D — Knowledge Sharing & Community Impact (standalone)

**One line:** Anonymized aggregation, public dashboards, reports, and remediation playbooks.

---

### Project E — PR Readiness Tracker & Contributor Dashboard 

**One line:** Web-based PR readiness checker with CI aggregation, discussion analysis, reviewer intent detection, and a contributor-facing dashboard.

**Description:** A single 350-hour project that answers "when is this PR actually ready?" in one place. **CI aggregation** combines all GitHub check runs and commit statuses into one pass/fail/pending state. **Discussion analysis** classifies review comments (e.g. actionable vs non-actionable vs resolved) and tracks thread resolution so contributors know what still needs a response. **Reviewer intent detection** distinguishes blocking feedback from suggestions and nitpicks (with support for common bots like CodeRabbit, Cursor, etc.). Contributors drop PRs into a **web dashboard** to track readiness across multiple PRs, re-check after addressing feedback, and get a clear status (e.g. READY, ACTION_REQUIRED, CI_FAILING). Aligns with GSoC goals around contributor tooling and AI-assisted workflows; can integrate with BLT's GitHub workflows and optionally feed into verification pipelines (e.g. Project A) later. Inspired by the [Good To Go](https://dsifry.github.io/goodtogo/) approach (deterministic PR readiness) but adds a BLT-hosted web UI and deeper discussion/reviewer-intent analysis.

### Project F — UI/UX Standardization & Component System

**One line:** Comprehensive UI/UX overhaul with design guidelines, responsive templates, and reusable component library to eliminate recurring UI fixes.

**Description:** Addresses the 25-40 monthly UI fix PRs by establishing a unified design system and component architecture. Creates strict design guidelines, responsive layout standards, and a library of reusable component templates. Includes comprehensive documentation, implementation guidelines, and migration strategy for existing UI elements. Focuses on accessibility compliance, cross-browser compatibility, and mobile responsiveness. Delivers a maintainable foundation that prevents future UI inconsistencies and reduces maintenance overhead.

---

### Project G — Architecture Modernization & Repository Restructuring

**One line:** Systematic dependency cleanup, repository splitting, and infrastructure documentation for improved maintainability and deployment workflows.

**Description:**
Extends Project E with a security-focused triage layer that analyzes PR diffs, CI results, and review context to identify potential security hardening issues (e.g., unsafe TLS configuration, token handling, CI/CD injection risks). Findings are _advisory only_ and exposed as GitHub check annotations/comments and a BLT-hosted web view. No exploit storage, no automated blocking, and no CVE detection.

**Scope-notes:**  
- Deterministic rules first; optional ML assistance for prioritization  
- Human-in-the-loop review to reduce false positives  
- Builds directly on Project E's CI aggregation and discussion analysis  
- Optional future integration with Project A is out of scope

---
### Project I — First-Time Contributor Experience & AI-Assisted Security Guide

**One line:** Security-first onboarding, documentation clarity, and an AI-assisted guide to help contributors understand BLT and OWASP expectations before contributing.

**Description:**
Improves BLT’s first-time contributor experience by addressing onboarding, navigation, and documentation gaps that lead to insecure or low-quality contributions. The project introduces a clear 
“start here” walkthrough for new users, security-focused information architecture, and contribution clarity pages that explain what qualifies as a security contribution and why PRs may be rejected.
Includes a constrained, explain-only AI Security Guide embedded into the website that answers contributor questions in beginner-friendly language using BLT documentation, GitHub Discussions, 
and OWASP public resources (e.g. OWASP Top 10, Cheat Sheet Series). The AI does not review code, analyze diffs, approve PRs, or generate exploit guidance; it is strictly scoped to explanation, 
clarification, and linking to authoritative sources.

### Project H — BLT Growth: Sizzle-First Contributor Progress & AI-Guided Issue Recommendation

**One line:** Time-aware contributor growth system that uses Sizzle (time tracking) to drive personal progress, AI-guided "what to work on next," and proactive mentoring on PR merge.

**Description:** A single 350-hour project that answers "where am I in my journey?" and "what should I work on next, and why?" for each contributor. Two delivery modes: (1) **Dashboard-based recommendations** where contributors pull AI-guided suggestions, and (2) **PR merged guidance** where the AI proactively reaches out when a PR is merged with "here's what you learned" + "here's your next challenge." **Progress tracker** shows where contributors actually spent time (Sizzle), skill focus inferred from Sizzle `focus_tag` (when set) and Issue labels (fallback) — e.g., XSS → SQLi → auth progression — and a **meaningful contribution** signal (alignment with BLT core vs slop). **AI-guided issue recommendation** suggests concrete next issues with **why this issue**, **what you'll learn**, and **estimated time** (~8h from Sizzle patterns). Gives **maintainers** capacity visibility and smart issue–contributor matching. Includes **Celery async infrastructure** for reliable LLM calls and **webhook extension** for PR merged events. AI uses Gemini free tier (or local model). Distinct from Project B (rewards) and Project F (leaderboards); H = personal growth + direction.

**Scope notes:**

- Sizzle alignment: Add optional `focus_tag` and `github_pr_url` to TimeLog.
- Async infrastructure: Celery + Redis for background LLM calls.
- Progress tracker: Journey view, skill focus, meaningful vs slop signal.
- AI recommendations: Gemini free tier; "why this issue" + "what you'll learn."
- PR merged guidance: Webhook extension + Celery task + AI guidance + notification delivery.
- Dashboard & APIs: Web UI, REST endpoints, testing, docs.
**Scope-notes:**

- Deterministic rules first; optional ML assistance for prioritization
- Human-in-the-loop review to reduce false positives
- Builds directly on Project E’s CI aggregation and discussion analysis
- Optional future integration with Project A is out of scope

**Description:** Comprehensive architectural review and modernization of the BLT website ecosystem. Identifies and removes unnecessary dependencies, splits monolithic components into focused repositories, and documents all systems and workflows. Includes DevOps pipeline optimization, deployment automation, and clear architectural decision records. Creates migration guides, dependency management strategies, and monitoring solutions. Establishes patterns for future development and reduces technical debt through systematic cleanup and documentation.

#### Project F — Security Contributor Trust & Reputation Engine

**One line:**  
Explainable trust scoring for security contributors based on verified fixes, reviews, and historical accuracy.

**Description:**
Implements a security-first reputation graph that aggregates verified security contributions across BLT (PR fixes, reviews, remediation outcomes) and computes contributor trust scores. The system emphasizes signal quality over volume, weighting factors like fix correctness, severity impact, review usefulness, and false-positive rates. Provides maintainers with confidence signals for triage and delegation, and exposes read-only APIs for downstream systems (rewards, dashboards, education). Designed with opt-in visibility, auditability, and strong anti-gaming controls.

## Decision guide

Choose by primary goal (one project per slot):

- **Rewards & recognition for verified security work** (BACON, badges, leaderboards, education bridge) → **Project B + light C**
- **CVE detection & verification pipeline** (GHSC, NVD, maintainer verification UI/API) → **Project A**
- **PR readiness & merge workflow** (CI aggregation, discussion analysis, reviewer intent, web dashboard) → **Project E**
- **Structured education & knowledge sharing** (labs, playbooks, dashboards, approval workflow) → **Project C + D** (combined into one 350h project)
- **Contributor growth, time-aware progress, and AI-guided "what to work on next"** (Sizzle-first, personal dashboard, maintainer capacity) → **Project H (BLT Growth)**
- **Trust & reputation scoring for contributors** (verified contribution tracking, explainable trust scores, anti-gaming controls) → **Project F**
- **UI/UX consistency & design system** (responsive templates, component library, design guidelines) → **Project F**
- **Infrastructure modernization & cleanup** (dependency removal, repository restructuring, documentation) → **Project G**

## Cross-cutting notes

- **Decoupling B from A:** B is designed around a generic "verified security contribution" event; it does not require Project A. Fixtures or a small admin UI can supply events during GSoC; A→B integration is optional later.
- **A + B in one 350-hour slot:** Not recommended; both need focused scope, testing, and pilot time. Treat as two separate projects.
- **C + D combined:** One 350-hour project is possible: education platform (tracks, labs, quizzes, review) plus knowledge-sharing (anonymization, dashboards, playbooks, approval workflow). Shares data and governance concerns.
- **Project E and A:** E (PR readiness) is independent. Optionally, "PR ready" from E could later feed into A's pipeline (e.g. only consider PRs for GHSC once readiness is READY or after manual triage), but that integration is out of scope for a single 350h slot.
- **Project H and B:** H (BLT Growth) focuses on personal growth and AI-guided recommendations; B focuses on rewards and leaderboards. H can optionally feed a "meaningful contribution" or alignment score to B for reward weighting, but H does not implement BACON or leaderboards itself. They are complementary: B = "you earned X"; H = "here's your growth path and what to do next."
- **Project E and A:** E (PR readiness) is independent. Optionally, “PR ready” from E could later feed into A’s pipeline (e.g. only consider PRs for GHSC once readiness is READY or after manual triage), but that integration is out of scope for a single 350h slot.
- **Project F as foundation for B:** F (trust & reputation) provides the scoring engine that B (rewards) can leverage. However, F is designed as a standalone system with read-only APIs. B can operate independently with simple contribution counts during GSoC; F→B integration is a natural evolution but not required.
- **F and A synergy:** A (detection & validation) produces verified fix events that F uses to build reputation scores. F's trust scores can help A prioritize which contributors' submissions to fast-track. Both benefit from shared data but can run independently.
- **Standalone F scope:** Project F focuses on the scoring engine, data model, anti-gaming controls, and API layer. UI/dashboards for displaying scores are minimal (admin-only); consumer-facing displays would be built by Projects B, C, or D as integrations.
